Documentation of codes needed for EMG practice in biomedical engg UGM
## Project: Signal Processing
Processing signal from EMG used in laboratory by doing open and close hand. Signal processing **purpose are to differentiate signal roughly in those 2 movements**
## Signal Procssing:
1. Moving standard deviation
2. Moving average
3. FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
4. Envelope
